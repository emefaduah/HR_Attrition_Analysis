Since most employees were leaving from the production department, I focused my analysis on attrition in the production department which is available in the repository.

# Insights
One third of the employees resigned from the company with almost 80% from the production department. According to the exploratory data analysis most of them resigned between the year 2011 and 2012.
* The Top three reasons were; they left for another job, unhappy and unsatisfied with their salary. 
* After a diagnostics check, it was discovered that; employees from production department had performance scores that fully met the companies requirement but were underpaid. The yearly average salary of employees in the production department was below average salary of company.
* Most of them also left  between 2011 and 2012 because their salary was not increased over the years but kept reducing. In 2009 the average salary was $75K , then reduced drastically to $65K in 2010 and reduces further to $59K in 2011 causing a lot of them to leave.

# Recommendations
* The HR  of the company should  consider increasing the salaries of employees in the production department since they are qualified and fully meets the requirement in order to reduce the attrition rate of the company. 
* This will make the company spend less money and time on recruiting new talents especially trainings, medicals, interviews and will increase the working efficiency  and productivity of the company
